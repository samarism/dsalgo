Data structures and algorithms:

1. [Cartesian Tree creation in linear time](./create_cartesian_tree_linear_time.py)
2. [Euler Tour of a Tree](./euler_tour_tree.py): the implementation returns both the values of euler nodes as an array and the depths of euler nodes as an array. Euler Tour of depths of a tree is useful in RMQ queries.
